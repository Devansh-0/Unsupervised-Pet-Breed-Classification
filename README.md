# Unsupervised-Pet-Breed-Classification
## Leveraging VGG16 to classify dog and cat breeds and predict labels using a confidence score.
### The Oxford Pet Dataset was utilized. The results showed a **93% accuracy** in classifying various breeds of cats and dogs. The model was deployed with a simple HTML interface, NGROK, and Flask on local machine.

##The goal of this project was to demonstrate expertise in using Image Classification Models.
